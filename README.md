# pharos

An introduction to pharos, is available in many different formats: [video](https://youtu.be/BAzsxW-nxh8), [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_of_Alexandria) and it was even [drawn by Micheal Turner](http://omeka.wustl.edu/omeka/files/original/2694d12580166e77d40afd37b492a78e.jpg).

More seriously, pharos is a small observable library that let's you create futures streams that observers can listen to.
